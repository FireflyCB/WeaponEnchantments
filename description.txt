Weapon Enchantments adds
     -Item customization
     -Progression system

Terraria has you frequently swapping old gear for new.
The enchanting system allows you to keep your progress as you upgrade gear.

Basics:
    Experience:
        -All weapons/armor/accessories gain experience when used to kill enemies. (Items have xp, not players)
        -Items have a level based on their xp. (Not visible if xp is 0)
    Enchantments:
        -Found in chests or dropped by enemies.
        -Added to items in an Enchanting Table.
        -Enchantments have a level cost
            Ex. A level 4 weapon can apply 2 Basic Damage Enchantments (cost 2 points each).
        -Require a larger Containment to upgrade an Enchantment.
    Essence:
        -Resource for upgrading Enchantments or consumed to add xp to items in an Enchanting Table.
    Enchanting Table:
        -Used to apply Enchantments to items.
        -Used to consume Essence to add xp to items.
        -Can PERMENANTLY consume items in exchange for Essence and ores(mix of iron/silver/gold).

First 5 minutes:
     -Make a Wood Enchanting Table. (workbench and 4 torches)
     -Fill your armor/accessory slots ASAP. (All equipped armor/accessories gains xp while equipped, so slap on your shackle and wood armor)

Tips:
    -DONT SELL weapons/armor/accessories. Offer them instead.  
        The value from ore recieved is slightly higher than an item's sell value and you get Essence equivalent to the item's xp. 
        Offering items returns all Enchantments/Power Booster applied to the consumed item.
    -Carrying an Enchanting Table with you to convert unwanted items is a good way to save inventory space.
    -Make a gem tree farm (especially for diamond/amber).  They are in crafting high tier Containments.

Extra information:
    Where do I get the good Enchantments?
        Unique Enchantments are obtained from chests/bosses.
        Pre-Hardmode bosses drop general Enchantments usable on all items.
        Post-Hardmode bosses drop more specialized Enchantments.
    Creating/Upgrading Enchantments
        Containments:
            Containments are used to hold Enchantments.  Higher power Enchantments require larger Containments.

                Ingredients - 4 Silver/Tungsten Bars, 1 Glass

                Used to upgrade an Enchantment from tier 0 to tier 1.

                Used to upgrade an Enchantment to tier 2, 3 or 4.
